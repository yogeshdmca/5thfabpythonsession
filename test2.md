1. Iterate 0 to 10 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
2. Iterate 10 to 0 using for loop, do the same using while loop.
3. Write a loop that makes seven calls to print(), so we get on the output the following triangle:

   ```py
     #
     ##
     ###
     ####
     #####
     ######
     #######
   ```

4. Use nested loops to create the following:

   ```sh
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   # # # # # # # #
   ```

5. Print the following pattern:

   ```sh
   0 x 0 = 0
   1 x 1 = 1
   2 x 2 = 4
   3 x 3 = 9
   4 x 4 = 16
   5 x 5 = 25
   6 x 6 = 36
   7 x 7 = 49
   8 x 8 = 64
   9 x 9 = 81
   10 x 10 = 100
   ```

6. Iterate through the list, ['Python', 'Numpy','Pandas','Django', 'Flask'] using a for loop and print out the items.
7. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only even numbers
8. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print only odd numbers
9. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all numbers.

   ```sh
   The sum of all numbers is 5050.
   ```


9. Declare a function named reverse_list. It takes an array as a parameter and it returns the reverse of the array (use loops).

```py
print(reverse_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
# [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(reverse_list1(["A", "B", "C"]))
# ["C", "B", "A"]
```

10. Declare a function named capitalize_list_items. It takes a list as a parameter and it returns a capitalized list of items
11. Declare a function named add_item. It takes a list and an item parameters. It returns a list with the item added at the end.

```py
food_staff = ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk'];
print(  add_item(food_staff, 'Meat'))     # ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk','Meat'];
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9];
print(add_item(numbers, 5))      [2, 3, 7, 9, 5]
```

12. Declare a function named remove_item. It takes a list and an item parameters. It returns a list with the item removed from it.

```py
food_staff = ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Mango', 'Milk'];
print(remove_item(food_staff, 'Mango'))  # ['Potato', 'Tomato', 'Milk'];
numbers = [2, 3, 7, 9];
print(remove_item(numbers, 3))  # [2, 7, 9]
```

13.  Declare a function named sum_of_numbers. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the numbers in that range.

```py
print(sum_of_numbers(5))  # 15
print(sum_all_numbers(10)) # 55
print(sum_all_numbers(100)) # 5050


```

14.  Declare a function named sum_of_odds. It takes a number parameter and it adds all the odd numbers in that range.


15. Use for loop to iterate from 0 to 100 and print the sum of all evens and the sum of all odds.

    ```sh
    The sum of all evens is 2550. And the sum of all odds is 2500.
    ```

16. Go to the data folder and use the countries.py file. Loop through the countries and extract all the countries containing the word _land_.
17. This is a fruit list, ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon'] reverse the order using loop.
